# Hackpad---macropad
I want to build a hackpad or macropad that i can use when watching yt videos or social media. This will help me for when watching and when editing content.
I have spent around 4.5 hours to do this, it took some time to get used to fusion 360 because it is my first time using it.

Note: there are two distinct files for the .step file, one for the top and one for the bottom


websites used to make the layout of buttons:
https://kbplate.ai03.com/

BOM - Components used:
- 4 keys
- 1 xiao rp2040-DIP
- 1 oled panel
- 4 sk6812MINI LEDs
- 1x pcb: price: 1.5 dollar

I rendered the files in fusion 360, and the result is as follows, though it wasnt possible to add the xiao rp2040 because of the many components i think
